# 3DModels

Due to working in a company, I have signed a confidentiality contract which stated not sharing any content used for the company, so I am not able to share any of my work while working there.

I used Maya to create the 3D objects and configure the texture map accordingly to the shape, then extracted the objects to Substance Painter in which I was able to create the textures for each texture map and export the materials. Those materials were used back into Maya to check them with different lighting and in specific scenes created by 3D Developers, and then imported into Unity for testing while using VR (e.g. clipping while moving would indicate issues that needed to be addressed).
